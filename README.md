# DeskTrek

**An open-source macOS walking game that drives your under-desk treadmill.**

> *You set out from your standing desk with a full pack, 211 trail miles ahead, and a treadmill that speaks Bluetooth. Morale is high. Energy is high. A marmot watches from the talus.*

DeskTrek pairs with your Bluetooth treadmill and turns every mile you walk into progress along a real-world trail — complete with an animated pixel-art hiker, wildlife drifting past in parallax, encounter choices that shift your morale and energy, and a printable certificate when you reach the summit. It lives in your menu bar, so it never steals your focus from the work you're actually supposed to be doing.

## Features

### Journey Mode — the headline feature

Pick a trail and start walking. Your treadmill miles accumulate along a real-world route, and the trail tells you a story as you go:

- **Animated pixel-art biome** — mountains, hills, and ground scroll in parallax; a 4-frame hiker walk cycle steps in time with your actual treadmill speed.
- **Landmarks** — named mile markers (Happy Isles, Half Dome, Cathedral Peak, Muir Pass, Mt. Whitney…) pass by with flavor text, a pixel sprite portrait, and an 8-bit chime when you reach them.
- **Trail signposts** — small wooden mile markers drift through the foreground so you can feel the miles ticking off even between named landmarks.
- **Encounters** — narrative choices appear at specific miles. A storm on the pass: push through or make camp? Each choice nudges your **morale** and **energy** bars and can award a badge.
- **Subquests** — multi-stage encounter chains that unlock a completion badge when you finish the arc (e.g. *Bear Canister Master*, *Sierra Storyteller*).
- **Ambient life** — clouds drift, eagles glide, marmots sit on talus, deer stand in the distance, the occasional bear moves through the treeline. Spawns are deterministic per-mile (seeded RNG), so the same stretch of trail always feels like the same stretch of trail.
- **Trophy wall** — every landmark you visit is collected as a pixel portrait. Every completed trail becomes a **printable PDF certificate** you can frame.
- **Pause and resume** — take a day off without losing progress. Re-baseline on your next walk.

Parchment palette. Monospaced fonts. Earth-tone UI panels and buttons that echo 90s edu-software. Context-aware trail messages across the app ("*You have mass-produced productivity. +2 morale.*"). 8-bit synthesized square-wave sound effects at workout start, workout end, goal achieved, and milestone reached — generated live at runtime in `Audio/SoundManager.swift`, so there are no WAV files to ship.

### Menu bar control center

Speed up, slow down, start, stop, and read live stats without leaving your workflow. One click in the menu bar, no app-switching.

### BLE treadmill control

Connects over Bluetooth Low Energy across four protocol families (see table below). Start, stop, pause, and adjust speed directly from your Mac.

### Goal tracking

Daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly goals for distance, time, or steps. Progress bars, streak tracking, goal-hit celebrations. Ambitions for the long haul.

### Auto-recording

Workouts start and stop themselves based on treadmill activity. No buttons — just walk.

### Smart notifications

Morning motivation, goal nudges, streak alerts, milestone celebrations. Rate-limited and configurable.

### Workout history & streaks

Full log of every session — distance, time, steps, calories. Consecutive-day streaks, because campfires need tending. Step counts are derived from distance and your stride length, so the numbers stay consistent even on treadmills that don't report steps natively.

## Shipping trail content

```
     /\
    /  \      JOHN MUIR TRAIL
   /    \     Yosemite Valley  ->  Mt. Whitney
  /      \    211 miles, 8 landmarks, 9 badges
 /________\
```

- **John Muir Trail** — 211 miles, Yosemite Valley to Mt. Whitney, 8 landmarks, 9 badges, narrative encounters + subquest arcs authored in [DeskTrek/Models/Journey/Content/JohnMuirTrail.swift](DeskTrek/Models/Journey/Content/JohnMuirTrail.swift).

Adding a new trail is a single Swift file plus one line in [DeskTrek/Models/Journey/TrailCatalog.swift](DeskTrek/Models/Journey/TrailCatalog.swift). Pixel art for landmarks, parallax layers, badges, and the finale scene is drawn programmatically in Swift in [DeskTrek/Views/Journey/Art/](DeskTrek/Views/Journey/Art/) — no sprite-sheet pipeline, no asset management.

## Supported treadmills

DeskTrek speaks four protocol families. If your treadmill shows up over Bluetooth, there's a good chance we've got a wagon hitched for it.

### DeerRun / PitPat
| Brand / Model | BLE Name | Status |
|---|---|---|
| DeerRun Urban Pro Plus | `PitPat-T01` | Confirmed |
| Other PitPat-compatible treadmills | `PitPat-*` | Community-tested |

| Other FitShow-compatible | `FS-*`, `SW*`, `MERACH-*`, `DB-*`, `XQIAO-*` | Contributions welcome |

Don't see your treadmill? Open an issue with the BLE name and we'll help you scout the trail.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Bluetooth Low Energy
- Xcode 15+ (to build from source)

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tehrenstrom/DeskTrek.git
cd DeskTrek
open DeskTrek.xcodeproj
```

1. Set your Development Team under **Signing & Capabilities**
2. Build and run (`⌘R`)

The app requests Bluetooth permissions on first launch.

## Architecture

DeskTrek uses an **adapter pattern** for treadmill support — each protocol family gets an adapter that conforms to `TreadmillAdapter`, and a registry matches discovered BLE devices to the right adapter. Journey Mode is a separate layer on top: a `JourneyEngine` consumes walked distance from `WorkoutRecorder`, advances trail state, triggers landmarks and encounters, and collects trophies.

## BLE protocols

The PitPat protocol was reverse-engineered with help from:

- [pitpat-treadmill-control](https://github.com/azmke/pitpat-treadmill-control) — Python implementation of the PitPat BLE protocol
- [pacekeeper](https://github.com/peteh/pacekeeper) — ESP32-based treadmill controller

The FTMS adapter implements the official [Bluetooth Fitness Machine Service](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/fitness-machine-service-1-0/) specification. KingSmith and FitShow protocols were reverse-engineered from BLE traffic captures.

### Test with your treadmill
If you have any Bluetooth treadmill, try DeskTrek and report how it works. Even a "it showed up but didn't connect" is valuable intel.

### Add a new treadmill adapter
1. **Create your adapter** — add a new file in [DeskTrek/BLE/Adapters/](DeskTrek/BLE/Adapters/) (e.g. `YourBrandAdapter.swift`) that conforms to `TreadmillAdapter` in [DeskTrek/BLE/TreadmillProtocol.swift](DeskTrek/BLE/TreadmillProtocol.swift).
2. **Register it** — add your adapter to the registry in [DeskTrek/Models/AppState.swift](DeskTrek/Models/AppState.swift) so DeskTrek tries it during discovery.
3. **Add to the Xcode project** — if you create the file through the IDE, Xcode handles `project.pbxproj` for you.
4. **Submit a PR** — include any BLE traffic captures or protocol notes that'll help future travelers.

### Add a new trail
Trails are pure Swift data plus programmatic pixel art. Use [DeskTrek/Models/Journey/Content/JohnMuirTrail.swift](DeskTrek/Models/Journey/Content/JohnMuirTrail.swift) as the reference shape:

1. **Write the trail content file** — define landmarks, encounters, subquests, and badges. Add flavor text.
2. **Draw the art** — add parallax layers, landmark sprites, and a finale scene to [DeskTrek/Views/Journey/Art/PixelSprites.swift](DeskTrek/Views/Journey/Art/PixelSprites.swift) using the `PixelCanvas` DSL. Register them under the sprite keys referenced by your trail.
3. **Register the trail** — add it to `TrailCatalog.all` in [DeskTrek/Models/Journey/TrailCatalog.swift](DeskTrek/Models/Journey/TrailCatalog.swift).
4. **Submit a PR** — include a note on the route, any historical/cultural context you leaned on, and screenshots of the finale scene.

### Report bugs
Open an issue with steps to reproduce. Bonus points for BLE logs.

### Submit PRs
Fork the repo, create a feature branch, submit a pull request. Keep commits focused and descriptions clear.
